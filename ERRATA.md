# Errata Register — Public Explainers vs. Statute Text

**Opened 17 August 2026.** Rule of this register: a research draft may honestly contain unresolved issues; it may not contain silent ones. Every entry below quotes the public claim, quotes the statutory text it diverges from, states which one is wrong, and states the fix and its status. Five entries are resolved by changing the **statute** (the explainer stated the design intent; the v3.3 text fell short of it — the text moves to match the promise). One entry (E6) was a plain copy error and is corrected in the explainer today. Nothing is deleted; corrections travel with the claims they correct.

Explainer line numbers are as of the 17 August 2026 revision. Statutory citations are to `model_act_v3_3.txt`.

## E1 — Engineer exemption: claimed as written; in fact implied, not yet express

**The claim** (`docs/03-whats-in-the-act.md`, line 16): "NOT liable: you, the engineer. **written into the definitions**: rank-and-file employees are exempt."

**The text** (SEC. 4(a)): a controlling person is "any natural person who, regardless of title, possesses or exercises material practical authority over a covered system through any of: (1) deployment, expansion, or access decisions; …" No subsection expressly excludes status, credentials, ministerial execution of another's decision, or technical ability standing alone.

**The gap.** The exemption is real in design — "material practical authority" is the operative screen — but it is *inferred* from the definition, not "written into" it. An aggressive reader could argue an engineer with production access makes "access decisions."

**The fix (statutory).** The controlling-person definition is narrowed to final material *independent* decision authority, with express textual exclusions for status, credentials, ministerial execution, and technical ability standing alone — making the explainer's sentence true on the face of the text. Queued for the public working branch (v3.4 cure list). The explainer claim stands as the binding design intent.

## E2 — Certification cadence: "every quarter" is not in the statute

**The claim** (`docs/03-whats-in-the-act.md`, lines 10 and 42): "the CEO personally signs a safety certification **every quarter**" / "CEO signs a safety cert **every quarter**, personally."

**The text** (SEC. 8): "**Before material deployment and following material change** to a covered model or configuration, the chief executive officer … shall personally certify …" The trigger is event-based. No quarterly or other periodic cadence appears anywhere in SEC. 8.

**The gap.** The explainer promised a rhythm the statute does not contain; event triggers alone are also independently attackable as vague ("per-configuration cadence," audit finding).

**The fix (statutory).** Certification triggers are being defined precisely, with a periodic batch cadence below the material-change line — giving the certification both the defined events and a regular clock. Until that lands, the accurate public sentence is: *the CEO signs before material deployment and after material change, personally and non-delegably.*

## E3 — "No signature, no shipping": the signature is not a gate, and a signed confession currently counts

**The claim** (`docs/03-whats-in-the-act.md`, line 10): "no signature, no shipping."

**The text** (SEC. 8): "a certification **disclosing identified noncompliance satisfies this section**." And SEC. 3(c)(2)(B): provisional validation may "document… the conformity … **or disclose… identified nonconformity and the compensating measures taken**."

**The gap.** Two divergences. First, certification is a duty with criminal consequences for lying (SEC. 6(b)(1)), not a shipping gate. Second — the serious one — a certification candidly disclosing unremediated noncompliance both satisfies SEC. 8 and, with "compensating measures" of unspecified adequacy, can support provisional validation. Truthfully disclosed unsafe deployment is punished nowhere in that configuration: it punishes lying, not shipping.

**The fix (statutory).** Validation is being rebuilt to require a reasonable documented conclusion of **material conformity**; compensating measures must be **equivalent**, judged against stated criteria; disclosure of nonconformity becomes a *report*, never a *validation*; and a certification disclosing unremediated material nonconformity constitutes neither compliance, validation, cure, nor a defense. Queued for the public working branch.

## E4 — "No waiting for an agency" vs. the Agency-approval validation mode

**The claim** (`docs/03-whats-in-the-act.md`, line 33, and the project's standing no-permit-regime design): the Act does not gate anyone's deployment on an agency's say-so.

**The text** (SEC. 3(b)): "The Agency shall specify for each standard the mode of validation (internal attestation, independent audit, accredited certification, **or Agency approval**)."

**The gap.** If the Agency selects the fourth mode for any standard, deployment lawfully waits on an affirmative agency act — a permit regime through the back door, contradicting the Act's own design and its commencement architecture, which was rebuilt specifically so that agency inaction can never stall the statute.

**The fix (statutory).** The Agency-approval validation mode is struck. Queued for the public working branch.

## E5 — "It was never going to be you": true for the weekend model, not yet true for the startup

**The claim** (`docs/03-whats-in-the-act.md`, line 22): "your fine-tune, your weekend model, your use, study & modification of weights: untouched. sec. 1 says so, out loud." (`README.md`, line 100: "Your startup is not in these chairs.")

**The text** (SEC. 1(b)(3)): "'deployer': the entity that … operates a covered model or system"; the express carve-outs are personal, noncommercial operation (SEC. 1(b)(3)) and use, study, or modification of weights "**except as part of the deployment of a covered system**" (SEC. 1(b)(9)).

**The gap.** The hobbyist claims are accurate. The startup claim is not yet: a company commercially operating a configuration of a covered frontier model is a deployer with SEC. 2 duties, and v3.3 contains no de-minimis rule and no reliance rule for non-modifying deployers. Every thin wrapper is, on the current text, a criminal-statute deployer.

**The fix (statutory).** A conduct-based de-minimis and reliance rule: non-modifying deployers discharge the duty by documented adoption of an upstream validation plus their own tool, credential, permission, and monitoring manifest. Never revenue-based. First in the cure queue.

*Addendum, 17 August 2026 (evening):* the same claim also appears in the dossier Q&A (`dossier/05_questions_and_answers.md`, startup answer). That page now carries the gap and the queued cure inline, same-day.

## E6 — Commencement: the copy error, corrected today

**The claim** (`docs/03-whats-in-the-act.md`, line 33, as published until 17 August 2026): "**it starts working day one** — no waiting for an agency that doesn't exist yet."

**The text** (SEC. 3(c)(1)–(2)): the truth-telling, incident-reporting, records, whistleblower, and liability provisions "arise and operate from the effective date, and do not depend upon … any … act of the Agency"; but "No duty arises under SEC. 2, and no offense lies under SEC. 5(a), before the provisional commencement of paragraph (2)" — which begins **[180] days** after the effective date, on interim standards adopted verbatim from enacted California, New York, and Illinois law.

**The status.** "No waiting for an agency" was and is correct — that is the point of the interim-standards design. "Starts working day one," unqualified, was wrong as to the core deployment offense. **Corrected in copy today** on the same card, with a dated note; the superseded wording is preserved here, per the no-deletion rule.

## E7 — The withdrawn PDF still called itself "the introducible text"

**The claim** (`CHANGELOG.md`, integrity patch, 17 August 2026): "'Introducible' retired **everywhere** until a gated sponsor release earns it back," and "`model_act_v3_3.pdf` **withdrawn** … The file stays in the tree for link integrity; the README no longer offers it."

**The artefact** (`model_act_v3_3.pdf` at the repository root, cover note, as shipped 16 August 2026): "[This file is the **introducible** text: SEC. 0 (uncodified findings) and SEC. 1 through SEC. 13. …]"

**The gap.** "Everywhere" missed the inside of the withdrawn file. De-listing removed the README's link, but the file still opened normally at the root path, carried no withdrawal notice, and self-described with the retired word — the last live instance of it in the tree. The `.txt` got its signpost at the old filename; the PDF's cover line got nothing. v2 and v3.2 both received one-page signpost PDFs; v3.3, the current version, was the only one without.

**The fix (packaging, applied 18 August 2026).** The v2/v3.2 practice, applied late: the typeset edition moves unchanged to `archive/model_act_v3_3_withdrawn.pdf` with its correction attached in the archive README, and a one-page signpost PDF holds the old root path so old links land on the honest label. Outside catch (a reader running a link-checker over the tree — 160 internal links, zero broken, one PDF that missed the memo). This is a packaging entry, the register's seventh; the five/one split described above covers E1–E6.

## Precision notes (audit record)

**N1 — New York penalty phrasing.** `audit/chunk3_penalty_architecture.md` §A.3 states the New York figures flatly ("$1,000,000 first / $3,000,000 per subsequent"). The enacted text (GBL § 1427, consolidated through 2026-04-03, pinned 17 August 2026 against nysenate.gov) phrases both as caps — "not to exceed" — with the amount "determined based on the severity of the violation." Chunk 3 §D.1 already characterizes the family as severity-scaled; §A.3's flat phrasing stands corrected to *caps, severity-scaled*. Public copy should say "up to."

**N2 — Explainer section numbering.** The "whole act, plainly" list on `docs/03-whats-in-the-act.md` uses its own compressed numbering (certification at "SEC.5," reporting at "SEC.6," penalties at "SEC.7"), which does not match the statute (certification SEC. 8; reporting SEC. 9; penalties SEC. 10; whistleblowers SEC. 11). The card's header already directs readers to the statute as authoritative. Logged so the divergence is a recorded choice, not an oversight; the list will be renumbered in the next docs pass.
